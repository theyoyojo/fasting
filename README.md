# Studies on fasting

[Short-term fasting induces profound neuronal autophagy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/auto.6.6.12376) [PDF](alirezaei_2010.pdf)

Summary:

* This was a study of autophagy in mice
* The study shows that autophagy occurs in mice brain cells
* The authors speculate that fasting, perhaps in humans, may induce potentially thereputic neural autophagy


[Suppression of basal autophagy in neural cells causes neurodegenerative disease in mice (2006)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04724)[PDF](hara_2006.pdf)

Summary:

* This was a study of autophagy in mice
* The study shows that suppression of natural autophagy in mice may lead to neurodegenerative diseases

[Fasting enhances growth hormone secretion and amplifies the complex rhythms of growth hormone secretion in man (1988)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329619/)[PDF](ho_1988.pdf)

Summary:

* This was a study of growth horomone (GH) in adult human males
* The authors conclude that level of nutrition in human had a significant effect on GH levels
